## üîç Professional Self-Assessment {#self-assessment}
Hello, my name is **Yelena Green**, and this is my Computer Science Capstone project portfolio at SNHU!
This portfolio showcases my work and the enhancements I made in **software design, algorithms, and databases**.

Completing the Computer Science program at SNHU and building my ePortfolio has been a great way to see just how much I‚Äôve grown as a software engineer. Over the past few years, I‚Äôve gained hands-on experience designing secure applications, optimizing data structures, and working with industry best practices. My capstone project, which focuses on improving the CardGrove mobile app, really highlights my ability to take existing software and make it more secure, efficient, and user-friendly. Whether it was refining the **forgot password feature** for better security, **encrypting sensitive data** in the database, or improving **sorting and filtering** to make the app more responsive, these enhancements show my ability to analyze problems and implement real-world solutions.

Beyond the capstone, my coursework has pushed me to build skills that go beyond just writing code. One of my most memorable experiences was in CS-405: Secure Coding, where I learned how to spot vulnerabilities and harden applications against security threats. For one project, I implemented defenses against SQL injection and buffer overflow attacks, which reinforced how critical security is in every stage of development. I also got a lot of experience collaborating with teams in CS-319: UI/UX Design class, where I worked on group projects that required clear communication and working with feedback from multiple people. These experiences helped me develop a solid foundation‚Äînot just in coding, but in problem-solving, teamwork, and thinking like a software engineer.

Looking at my portfolio as a whole, it‚Äôs clear how my skills in secure coding, database management, and software development have come together. The Forgot Password enhancement shows my ability to design secure authentication workflows, the database encryption update proves my understanding of protecting sensitive user data, and the sorting and filtering improvements highlight my ability to work with algorithms and optimize performance. All of these projects, along with the challenges I‚Äôve tackled in my coursework, make me confident that I can step into a software engineering role and make an impact. I‚Äôm excited to take everything I‚Äôve learned and apply it to real-world development, whether that‚Äôs in security, backend development, or full-stack applications.

## üöÄ Enhancements

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancement One: Software Design and Engineering
**GitHub Branch:** [View Enhancement One Branch](https://github.com/yelena-green/SNHUCS-499/tree/feature/Milestone1_forgot-password)

The artifact I chose to enhance is the **Forgot Password feature** for the Card Grove application, initially created during my coursework in mobile application development. This feature allows users to securely reset their passwords by requesting a temporary password sent to their email and then setting a new password upon login. The original implementation provided a basic workflow but lacked **robust security measures, clear user flows, and industry best practices** for managing sensitive information. The enhancement was made as part of my capstone project to demonstrate my growth in software design and engineering practices.

I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it highlights my ability to **design user-centered features while implementing secure and maintainable software**. The enhancements showcase my skills in **building dynamic user interfaces, designing workflows, and integrating backend functionality**. I improved the feature by adding **password validation, secure storage and handling of temporary passwords, and user-friendly layouts** that align with real-world software design standards.

Through this enhancement, I achieved several **course outcomes** related to software design and engineering. By revisiting and refining the artifact, I improved my proficiency in **designing secure workflows and implementing solutions** that address real-world scenarios. This experience validated my outcome-coverage plans from Module One, as I successfully incorporated **industry best practices** while achieving a **user-centered, secure design**.

The process of enhancing this artifact was a **valuable learning experience**. One challenge I faced was ensuring a **seamless user flow between the Forgot Password and Reset Password activities**, particularly when handling **layout inconsistencies and debugging database operations**. This enhancement allowed me to **solidify my ability to design, implement, and improve software** in alignment with professional standards.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structures
**GitHub Branch:** [View Enhancement Two Branch](https://github.com/yelena-green/SNHUCS-499/tree/feature/Algorithms_DataStructure_sorting)

The artifact I am presenting is the **sorting and filtering functionality** added to the CardGrove mobile application, originally developed in my **Mobile Application Development** course at SNHU. The CardGrove app helps users **manage their card inventory efficiently**. This enhancement introduces the ability to **sort cards by name, type, or inventory count** and to **filter cards using a search bar**.

I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it demonstrates my ability to work with **algorithms and data structures** in a real-world mobile application. Implementing **sorting and filtering** required a solid understanding of how to **retrieve and manipulate data efficiently**. I used **SQL queries with ORDER BY** to perform sorting directly in the database and implemented a search function using **LIKE** to filter results dynamically.

This enhancement aligns with **CS-499 course outcomes**, particularly in the areas of **software engineering best practices, algorithms, and data optimization**. The sorting functionality ensures **efficient data retrieval**, while the filtering feature provides **real-time responsiveness**. These improvements significantly strengthen the application's **performance and maintainability**.

Throughout the process, I learned the importance of **database efficiency and debugging SQL queries**. One of the challenges was ensuring **sorting by type worked correctly**. Initially, the query did not return the expected results because the column name was not mapped correctly. I resolved this by **verifying database column names and debugging using Log.d()**. Another challenge was ensuring that **filtering did not cause performance issues**, which I addressed by **using database-side filtering instead of in-memory filtering**.

This experience reinforced my skills in **handling structured data efficiently** and optimizing **mobile application performance**. The feature has been successfully **merged into the main branch**, marking a **significant milestone** in refining the application.
